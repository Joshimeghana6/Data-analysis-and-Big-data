# Data-analysis-and-Big-data
This is a single, end-to-end Python program that starts from basic data loading and incrementally moves toward a production-grade, multi-engine analytics pipeline using the same dataset (flight_delays.csv).
This design reflects how real-world data systems evolve from simple scripts to enterprise-ready analytics engines.
